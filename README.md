**Group Homework - HW2 Anomaly Event Detection**

***
Use a threshold based method and a fixed size window to find anomaly events.Find an appropriate window size and initial threshold.
Normal event detection accuracy rate (at least 80%) and anomaly event detection accuracy rate (at least 75%).

Below accuracy rates are determined with window size 6 and Threshold is 95%.

Normal event detection accuracy rate is 83.77  
Anomaly event detection accuracy rate is 75.32
